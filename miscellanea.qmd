The frequentist approach evaluates evidence from a single new experiment, most often using a p-value as a measure for deciding whether a hypothesis is true or false. The Bayesian approach formally and statistically quantifies prior knowledge ($D_0$) about a hypothesis ($H$) in the form of a prior probability ($P_0$), which is then combined with the evidence from a new experiment ($D_N$) to compute a posterior probability ($P_1$) about the veracity of that hypothesis. The posterior probability can be recycled as input to form the prior for a subsequent experiment, thereby creating a virtuous cycle of synthesizing scientific knowledge about a hypothesis.
