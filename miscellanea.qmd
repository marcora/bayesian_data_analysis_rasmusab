The frequentist approach evaluates evidence from a single new experiment, most often using a p-value as a measure for deciding whether a hypothesis is true or false. The Bayesian approach formally and statistically quantifies prior knowledge ($D_0$) about a hypothesis ($H$) in the form of a prior probability ($P_0$), which is then combined with the evidence from a new experiment ($D_N$) to compute a posterior probability ($P_1$) about the veracity of that hypothesis. The posterior probability can be recycled as input to form the prior for a subsequent experiment, thereby creating a virtuous cycle of synthesizing scientific knowledge about a hypothesis.

## Random variables

$\text{rv} \sim \text{Binomial}(\text{prob}, \text{n})$

```{r}
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
coin = c("H", "T")
n = 10
prob = 0.7

sample.space = expand.grid(rep(list(coin), times = n), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% tibble %>% unite("outcome", all_of(1:n), sep = "")

sample.space

probability.table = sample.space %>% mutate(p = prob^str_count(outcome, pattern = "H") * (1 - prob)^str_count(outcome, pattern = "T"))

probability.table

sum(probability.table$p)

random.variable <- function(outcome) { str_count(outcome, pattern = "H") }

probability.distribution = probability.table %>% mutate(rv = random.variable(outcome))

probability.distribution

probability.distribution %<>% group_by(rv) %>% summarise(p = sum(p))

probability.distribution

probability.distribution %>% ggplot(aes(x=rv, xend=rv, y=p, yend=0)) + geom_point() + geom_segment()
```
