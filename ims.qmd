## Introduction to data

### Hello data

#### Case study: Using stents to prevent strokes

Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions/learn from data.

We start by writing the main question researchers hope to answer:

> Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?

Researchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control group.

Researchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 365 days after enrollment.

```{r}
stent30
```

```{r}
stent365
```

A **summary statistic** is a single number summarizing data from a sample, e.g., the proportion of people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.

```{r}
rbind(stent30 %>% mutate(time = "30"), stent365 %>% mutate(time = "365")) %>%
  tabyl(group, outcome, time) %>%
  adorn_totals("row") %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0) %>%
  adorn_ns %>%
  adorn_title
```

Suppose you flip a fair coin 100 times. While the chance a fair coin landing heads in any given flip is 50%, we probably won't observe exactly 50 heads. **Variation is part of almost any type of data generating process**. It is possible that the 8% difference in strokes between the control and treatment group after one year is due to this variation. However, the larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is that the difference is due to chance. So, what we are really asking is the following: if in fact stents have no effect, how likely is it that we observe such a large difference?

### Data basics

#### Observations, variables, and data frames

```{r}
loan50
```

Each row in the table represents a single loan. The formal name for a row is a **case** or **observational unit**. The columns represent characteristics of each loan, where each column is referred to as a **variable**. It is especially important to know what each variable means and its units of measurement.

The table above represents a **data frame**, which is a convenient and common way to organize data, especially if collecting data in a spreadsheet. A data frame where each row is a unique case (observational unit), each column is a variable, and each cell is a single value is commonly referred to as **tidy data**.

When recording data, use a tidy data frame unless you have a very good reason to use a different structure. This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables as new columns and facilitates visualization, summarization, and other statistical analyses.

#### Types of variables

#### Relationships between variables

Many analyses are motivated by researchers looking for a relationship between two or more variables.

**Scatterplots** are one type of graph used to study the relationship between two numerical variables.

```{r}
county
```

```{r}
county %>% ggplot(aes(x=multi_unit, y=homeownership)) + geom_point()
```

The `multi_unit` and `homeownership` variables are said to be associated because the plot shows a discernible pattern. When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called **associated** variables.

If two variables are not associated, then they are said to be **independent**. That is, two variables are independent if there is no evident relationship between the two.

We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each idea to determine which are the most reasonable explanations.

#### Explanatory and response variables
